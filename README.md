## 🧠 Current Research Focus
Designing an intelligent, feedback-driven survey platform to assess smartphone addiction among university students using standardized scales like SAS-SV. The system delivers real-time, personalized feedback after each question and classifies users by behavioral risk. It integrates LLMs (Mistral-7B via Hugging Face) for dynamic insights and machine learning models for risk profiling. The platform also supports repeat participation with unique user codes to track behavioral trends over time.
**Tools:** Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, OpenAI API
